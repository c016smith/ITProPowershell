<#
.SYNOPSIS
Retrieve a domain's Azure tenant ID anonymously
Takes input from function and creates a local certificate which can be used for future powershelling with Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA) of certain powershell modules, as well as getting tokens for making REST calls to Graph API (or other APIs)


.DESCRIPTION
This function will anonymously retrieve a domain's Azure tenant ID using a provided email containing the target domain or a domain itself.

.PARAMETER Domain
The full domain of the Azure tenant.

.PARAMETER 

.EXAMPLE
Get-AzureCert contoso.com
Get-AzureCert contoso.onmicrosoft.com
Get-AzureCert -domain contoso.com -folderpath 'c:\temp\cert\'  (use the final \ after folder name)


.NOTES
HUGE credit to https://github.com/cporteou/PowerShell-Tools.git for the start of this script - I (c016smith) am brand new to using github and vscode for powershell scripts, so I got this module from him but not sure how to include it in my project while appropriately crediting this developer. Apologies in advance; would like to learn how to fork and merge other people's code into the middle of my own project that has other functionality, but I'm a total noob at the moment. : ) Thanks for understanding. 
I've removed the functionality of the -email flag and only using domain as an input, and also made this mandatory.
General notes - taking this function and expanding it to produce the full certificate and export (prompting for path).
